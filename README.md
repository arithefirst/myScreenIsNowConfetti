## ðŸŽ¯ Game Mechanics

### Health System
- Start with 3 health points
- Lose 1 health when touching an enemy
- Collect health power-ups to restore health (max 3)
- Game ends when health reaches 0

### Power-up System
- **Health Power-up** (Red Heart): Restores 1 health point (up to maximum of 3)
- **Time Slow Power-up** (Hourglass): Slows down all enemy movement by 50% for 4.5 seconds
- Power-ups spawn randomly every 5-7 seconds
- Health power-ups only work if you're below maximum health
- Time slow effect doesn't stack - collecting another while active has no effect

### Scoring
- +10 points for each enemy that self-destructs
- -25 points for taking damage (minimum score: 0)

### Stage Progression
The game features 6 stages (0-5) plus an endless mode:
- Enemy spawn rate increases each stage
- Enemy movement speed increases
- Background themes change
- Stage 6+ becomes "ENDLESS" mode
